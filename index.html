        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented 
            scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. 
            Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
            JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
            environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, 
            such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, 
            control structures, and statements. 
            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes 
            by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

        <ul class="list-container">
          <li class="list-item">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">For example, client-side extensions allow an application 
            to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, 
            form input, and page navigation
              </li>
          <li class="list-item">  Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
     </li>
          <li class="list-item"> For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, 
            or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
          <li class="list-item">from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

        <header class="section-header">JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
        <header class="section-header">Declaring variables</header>
        <p class="paragraph">You can declare a variable in three ways:
            With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code class="code">var x = 42.</code>

        <p class="paragraph">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

            By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code class="code">var x = 42.</code>

        <p class="paragraph">This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

            With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code class="code"> let y = 13.</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
        <header class="section-header">Variable scope</header>
        <p class="paragraph">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
        <code class="code">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>

        <p class="paragraph">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

        </p>
        <code class="code">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
        <header class="section-header">Global variables</header>
        <p class="paragraph">Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
